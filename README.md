# matlab_functions
Some functions created for matlab.
In our extensive work in MultiCriteria Decision Making we have developed matlab functions that we want to share.
First function is a Pareto-Optimality check.
paretoGlobal_min has one input, a matrix with objective values for some evaluated solutions.
Rows are the solutions and their values in each objective are in each column.
esPareto_min is used inside paretoGlobal_min.

These functions were created by me https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5886-8764 and any use is allowed but should be credited if published.
